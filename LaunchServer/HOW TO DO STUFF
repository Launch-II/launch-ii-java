Stuff to change to switch the app between standard and "Launch! Debug" builds:
-AndroidManifest.xml; change manifest tag at the top, and change meta-data tag for maps API key further down.
-build.gradle (Module: app); change applicationId under defaultConfig.
-Rename app package name; com.apps.fast.launch(test).
-strings.xml; change app_name.
-LaunchComms.java; change SERVER_ADDRESS and SERVER_PORT, if applicable.

"This uses a build config from another version" (or similar prompt):
-ALWAYS select "Update".
